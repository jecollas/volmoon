    <p>Something is hunting the people of Bedburg, Germany. Or at least, that's what the townsfolk there are claiming. You've been receiving frantic letters and reports about this for some time now. Cows mutilated, children going missing, and the bodies of young men and women found mangled in the woods almost beyond recognition. Ordinarily, you would have written all of this off as hysteria over an unfortunate series of animal attacks (wolves aren't uncommon in that area, after all), but things had changed when you received word of a most gruesome discovery.</p>

    <p>Severed limbs had been found neatly tucked away in one of the fields outside of Bedburg. It wasn't the buried remains of an animal's half-finished meal, either. The letter from which you learned this news stated that the macabre scene had been arranged so that an unbloodied hand was just visible through the underbrush. According to the letter, the person who stumbled upon the display initially thought that the hand belonged to a person in distress. They learned the truth once they pushed aside the leaves and branches, but the sight was enough for them to lose consciousness for several minutes after the fact.</p>

    <p>You could make all sorts of doubts and excuses, but the letter had explicitly stated that the missing limbs had been arranged, not left behind. It was your job to investigate such strange goings-on, and despite your earlier misgivings, this wasn't something that you could easily ignore. Whichever manner of creature responsible for this was trying to send a message; it wasn't just hunting the people of Bedburg, it was doing it for sport.</p>

    <p>All of this and more runs through your head as you continue along the main road. You are making good time for foot travel, but the autumn sun is setting earlier by the day, and you can't help but feel slightly nervous. After all, the thing that you are meant to be investigating kills lone travelers on these very roads, and you do not want to count yourself amongst its victims. At least, not yet.</p>
  choice1: Keep walking. You will surely make it before nightfall.

    <p>Your studies of the road map have paid off, and there are no unexpected diversions in your path. That is, until you come upon a fork in the road. The signpost in the middle tells you that you take will reach Bedburg no matter which direction you take, so you pause and look down either path.</p>

    <p>To the left, the path continues on through the woods. The road is much the same as the one you are currently on, and you think to yourself that it is likely the main road that travelers take into Bedburg. To the right, the woods go off for a ways before opening into what looks like a cow pasture. You hear the braying of cattle, as well as the distant sounds of indistinct sounds of children yelling as they play.</p>
  choice1: Left, through the woods.
  choice2: Right, towards the cow pasture.

    <p>After a moment's consideration, you head off the beaten path and towards the cow pasture. The darkening woods were starting to give you the creeps, and besides! It never hurts to have change in scenery.</p>

    <p>The sounds of giggling and shrieking gets louder as you approach, and as you get closer you can make out what looks to be five or six children darting between cattle as they chase each other in a frenzied game of tag. There are two farmers working in the field just beyond the fence (likely these children's fathers). Neither they nor their children seem to notice the setting sun. Or, if they do, they do not pay it any heed. You lean against one of the fence posts for a moment, watching the children as they play.</p>

    <p>As you do, one of the cattle takes notice of you. It turns to look at you with its big brown eyes, you gesture it over with some grass pulled fresh from the ground. The cow ambles over to sniff it, and when it eats from your hand you offer it an affectionate scratch behind the ears. Its hair is soft and pleasant, and you can't help but smile at the sensation.</p>
  choice1: Take a break. Bedburg can wait a moment's rest.

    <p>A moment becomes a minute, and one minute turns into two. The sky is burning gold into rust as the twilight sets in and brings along the sounds of night. The cow hasn't bothered moving yet, seeming rather contented to let you stay and scratch under its chin. It lets out a contented moo – a sound that joins the chorus of buzzing insects and laughing children.</p>

    <p>You want to stay longer and rest your aching legs, but the momentary peace is wrinkled by the setting sun. You really should be on your way. You reluctantly let go of your new cow friend (maybe you can come back and visit) so that you can readjust the heavy pack on your shoulders, and whether by fate or by design, that is the moment when you look up and see a dark shape latching feral jaws around the neck of one of the little girls.</p>

    <p>The dying of the light isn't the only thing to have gone unnoticed, but just as you might have wondered how anyone could miss something as obvious as a setting sun, you marvel to yourself how anyone could have possibly missed the thing that now stands before you.</p>

    <p>It is more massive than any creature that silent has any right to be, and in the split second that you lay eyes on it, the only thing you can see is the girl's face – her eyes wide in a silent mask of fear – and the thing's teeth digging into her throat and staining her white collar a dark, weeping red.</p>

    <p>Panic and anger spurs you into action, and without any thought or hesitation, you reach out smack your new cow friend in the rump with the palm of your hand. The cow lets out a startled cry and surges forwards, running away from you and more importantly, directly towards the thing that holds the little girl in peril.</p>

    <p>You hear screams of shock as the other children scatter from the path of the oncoming animal, which quickly devolve into wailing cries of terror as they all look to see where the cow is running, and see instead a vision that likely they had only seen in the throes of their worst nightmares.</p>

    <p>The ground rumbles beneath your feet as the tide of stampede begins to swell. The creature may have been able to avoid being trampled by one cow, but it will not be able to escape the rest of them. The creature turns, and in that moment you know that it aims to leave with the little girl as its prize.</p>

    <p>Your heavy pack hits the ground, and then you're over the wooden fence and sprinting as hard and as fast as you can. You scream, and for one terrible moment, the creature turns and focuses its gaze on you. Its eyes burn a gold that is brighter and more full of hatred than the fiery pits of hell, and were it not for the blood pounding in your ears you would have been frozen where you stand.</p>

It yelps in pain, and in that moment, lets go of the little girl. Her body is airborne, limp like a doll's when the creature tosses her aside. You dive towards her, arms outstretched, and snatch her out of the air. You tumble, and as you fall into the path of the stampede you fold yourself around the bleeding girl to shield her from any further harm.</p>

    <p>It was stupid, what you did. Brave, reckless, and very stupid. There is an eternity of dust and blood and thundering hooves before the world falls silent once again. Your ears ring with white noise. For a long moment, you are convinced that you're dead.</p>

    <p>Small, shaking hands snap you back to the real world, and you are hit with the gravity of what just happened. The townspeople weren't lying. The Monster of Bedburg is real, and it almost killed someone right in front of you. You got a good look at the thing earlier – or at least, you thought you did. Did it stand on two legs? Four legs? Did it have a fangs or a human grin? You don't know. You can't remember. All you know for certain is its molten golden gaze. There is no animal in the world with eyes like that. No human, either.</p>

    <p>That sobering thought haunts you as the girl balls her hands into fists and sobs into your shirt. You gently rub her back in an attempt to soothe her, but otherwise make no sudden movements. The sun is almost fully behind the trees by the time one of the two farmers comes sprinting over. He gasps the little girl's name and falls to his knees.</p>

    <p>The girl finally lets go of you to reach for the man that you assume to be her father. They embrace – both father and daughter falling into a fresh wave of sobs. The girl's father thanks you again and again and again as you lay in the dirt and wheeze.</p>

    <p>The other farmer approaches and offers you a hand to pull you up. You take it, but the moment you're upright your vision smears, and you almost fall back over from the pain. The farmer that's helping steady you makes a joke about bruises in the shape of hoof prints, but your mind is racing too quickly to find any humor in it. Those eyes. They burn in your memory. Gold like the setting sun. Gold like the hottest of Hellfire.</p>

    <p>You're half escorted, half carried to a wagon that the farmers say is on its way to Bedburg. You moan out something about your pack. You can't leave your pack behind. You have important things in there. It's placed next to you on the wagon. Your vision smears again as it starts moving, and you stifle the yelp that goes with it.</p>

    <p>Those eyes. There was such malice in them. You have never seen anything like them before. You doubt that you will ever see anything like them again, unless you're unlucky enough to happen upon the Monster of Bedburg a second time. You watch as the sun's last stubborn remnants finally fade into night, and know with a cold sort of finality that a creature that possesses eyes such as those cannot be natural. It is evil, and you will stop at nothing to vanquish it.</p>

    <p>You're half escorted, half carried to a wagon that the farmers say is on its way to Bedburg. You hear them and nod, but you cannot stop thinking about the creature's monstrous gaze. You never made eye contact with the creature directly, but it was hard to miss the malice in those eyes – hatred and glee like you have never seen before. You do not wish to see them again.</p>

    <p>You close your eyes and mumble to yourself as the cart rolls forward into the woods and onto the road towards town. The townspeople weren't lying. The Monster of Bedburg is real. A girl almost died today, and all you did was run and scream for help. But, what were you supposed to do against a creature such as that? It is evil, unnatural, and as the last stubborn remnants of sunlight bleed from day, you despair to think what will happen should you have to face that monstrous gaze again.</p>

    <p>Panic and fear roots you to the spot. Your fingers clench around the straps of your pack and you watch with wide unblinking eyes as the creature creature starts to move. It shakes its head back and forth, adjusting its grip on her with its teeth. It's going to drag her away, you realize. It will take her and kill her and leave her body slaughtered and mangled for some poor soul to find.</p>

    <p>Time has slowed to a crawl, and your eyes are still locked on the girl's frightened face. There's movement around her (and around you as well), but the moment might as well have been an oil painting for how much you could actually see and focus on.</p>

    <p>The other children haven't noticed anything yet. How haven't they noticed? The hulking creature has had their friend between its teeth for what feels like years, but none of them have turned to look.</p>

    <p>And what of the cattle? Weren't cows supposed to be able to notice intruders in their midst? Weren't they able to sense predators nearby? The farmers hadn't noticed anything either, too wrapped up in their work to turn and check on the children in their care.</p>

    <p>The girl looks at nothing, but her stare feels accusatory. Why haven't you moved? Why haven't you screamed? Why haven't you done anything yet?</p>

    <p>In the end, the girl is her own hero. The creature's teeth clamp down harder on her neck. She whimpers in pain as the bloodstains on her dress widen from pools to lakes, and it's almost as if the involuntary sound reminds her that she is still able to scream. Her mouth drops open, and the sound that comes out is less the scream of a girl in pain, and more the cry of a dying animal. It tears through you, standing the hair on the back of your neck, and that moment – that oil painting that trapped you for an eon and an age – comes undone.</p>

    <p>There is a reason why children should not be allowed to play where cattle graze. Cows are easily startled creatures, and sometimes a scream is all it takes to cause the herd to stampede. But this? The wounded wail of a girl whose life is about to end? The creature never stood a chance.</p>

    <p>You watch, helpless as the creature tried to flee with the girl still held in its jaws. It is big, strong, and no doubt fast enough to avoid being trampled by one or two of the cattle, but there was no way that it would be able to escape the rest of them. At least, not with the little girl still in its grasp. She would only slow the thing down, and spell its inevitable doom.</p>

    <p>The creature drops the girl. She crumples like a discarded doll and was lost to your unblinking eyes. The creature, on the other hand, was not. It turns to flee, and when it does its eyes lock on yours and only then do you finally lose strength and fall to your knees.</p>

    <p>The creature's eyes are a brilliant, burning, blazing gold. Hateful like Hellfire and molten like metal from a blacksmith's forge. They are not the eyes of a human, but never in your life had you seen an animal whose gaze held that much intelligence and that much intent to kill.</p>

    <p>They burn through you, those eyes. They stare into your very being and weigh the contents of your soul. You do not know how this creature finds you, but it is unlikely that you are worthy of being spared. The townspeople weren't lying. The Monster of Bedburg is real, and it will hunt you like an animal if you give it half the chance.</p>

    <p>You blink, and the creature has turned away and ran off. The spell held over you is broken, and you hold your arms around you to ward off the chill of certainty that if you were to face the creature alone, you would not enough to end its reign of terror.</p>

    <p>The herd finally passes, leaving the girl visible and unmoving. For a terrifying moment, you are convinced that she's dead. Then one of the farmers sprints past your field of vision and scoops the girl into a tight embrace, and you hear the unmistakable sound of muffled crying. Relief pushes the air from your lungs and you hang your head so that you aren't faced with the shame of your own inaction.</p>

    <p>The girl is fine. Or at least, she will be. The farmer holding her (her father, most likely) gently lifts her from the ground. The other children follow him like a shadow as he strides over to a waiting wagon and gently lays her down in the back. You hope beyond hope that none of the other children were hurt in the scuffle. None of them appear to be, but you know with intimate clarity that appearances can be deceiving.</p>
  choice1: Rise, little deer. You still have yet a ways to go before nightfall.

    <p>Shadows begin to stretch as you continue to wind your way through the woods. Night has not quite fallen yet, but the dense foliage hides the setting sun and makes everything darker in comparison. You have a lamp and tinderbox tucked away in your pack, but they don't make the idea of traveling alone at night any easier to bear. There is something hunting the citizens of Bedburg, after all. You would rather not be among the missing.</p>

    <p>The sky is a burning orange when you give up and pause to light your lamp. Sudden light dances around you, hurting your eyes and making the shadows even more stark with its contrast. You close your tinderbox with a click and stow it back in your pack before hastening your step.</p>

    <p>A part of you whispers that your journey should not have taken this long, and that surely this means that you are lost.</p>

    <p>You shake that thought away as soon as it comes. <i>No, you are not lost. You studied the map and your route carefully. You followed the markers. You are on the right path. Bedburg is no more than a half-hour away, and you will be there soon.</i></p>

    <p>You approach the group of travelers and introduce yourself to them with a wave. The three of them– two young men whose names you learn to be Johann and Fritz, and a young woman who introduces herself as Lena. They make good company and conversation, but they do not share your same sense of urgency.</p>

    <p>You try not to be too visibly frustrated by the slowed pace of your new companions when you turn and ask them how much longer it would be until you reached the town ahead. You have been traveling all day, after all, and find yourself keener and keener to leave this woods and find a place to rest.</p>

    <p>You nod, only somewhat satisfied with the answer and easy smile that Fritz gives you, and look where he points. You have to squint your eyes and crane your neck forward to see through the trees, but sure enough, you can just make out the great stone wall that encircles the entire town.</p>

    <p>Once you see it, you're also able to pick out the smell of smoke and cooking meat. You probably would have been able to sense it sooner had it not been for the stink of the lamp in your hand.</p>

    <p>Somewhat reluctantly, you tell your new friends that you've been sent for to investigate what's been happening in Bedburg. The people going missing, the cattle being slaughtered, the bodies being found in the woods. They listen in solemn silence, the good-natured expressions having gone from their faces. They know something, that much is obvious.</p>

    <p>You're careful as you pose the question. Do any of you know what might be causing this?</p>

    <p>Johann, Lena, and Fritz share a look. They're scared, that much is certain. Then, Fritz asks if you believe in the Devil.</p>

    <p><i>We're being punished for something, he says. I don't know what. But whatever's out there... It's not human. It's not an animal either. It's some kind of demon, taunting us and keeping us scared.</i></p>

    <p><i>We're not scared, though,</i> Johann cuts in. <i>We think it's just a wolf, and that the town priest is pulling one over everyone.</i> That gets a laugh, albeit a slightly uncomfortable one.</p>

    <p>You urge your new friends to ignore it. Whatever's happening is not your business. The woods are dangerous, and if any of you were to go out and investigate, you would surely meet the same fate as the poor soul calling for aid.</p>

    <p>The pushback is immediate. Johann looks shocked and angry, and demands to know why you think the person out there is so unworthy of assistance. <i>Who are you to say that your life is worth more than a stranger's?</i> You feel your face burning, but don't say anything in your own defense.</p>

    <p>You watch as Johann pushes his way past the tree line and is immediately engulfed by shadow. He calls out to the hidden voice, asking it where it is, to stay there, and assuring that help is on the way. His voice fades quickly, as does the sound of crunching leaves and breaking sticks that mark Johann's footfalls. Even the light of his lantern becomes invisible past the trees and the growing dark.</p>

    <p>You, Lena, and Fritz wait on the edge of the road, eyes and ears pricked for any sign of either Johann or the person he went to assist. You wait for one minute, then another, then another, then another. Five minutes pass, but the darkness and dread building in your gut makes it feel like longer.</p>

    <p>You raise a hand and interrupt. The relief on Fritz's face is palpable as you tell him to wait there with Lena. They stand close, their lamp light creating a point of origin as you venture off the beaten path and into the woods.</p>

    <p>You call out Johann's name as you scan the trees and surrounding brush for any sign of the missing man. At some point you realize that you can't see Lena and Fritz's lamp light anymore, and it's in that same moment when something catches your attention out of the corner of your eye.</p>

    <p>There's a slight movement amongst the trees. You can't hear the telltale sounds of footsteps, but something is moving the nearby branches, and it is too heavy to the autumn wind. You turn your oil lamp in that direction, scanning the foliage for something, anything. Your heart almost stops when you see a pair of eyes reflecting your lamp light back at you.</p>

    <p>The thing emerges from the dark. It approaches on all fours like an animal, but is standing on two legs by the time it steps into your small circle of light. It is massive – too large to be human, but human enough to be wearing shoes. It smiles at you, its jagged teeth a gleaming white save for the fresh blood that still decorates its lips.</p>

    <p>That's not what scares you the most, though. Not its size, not its teeth, not the fact that it will likely kill you if you don't start running. No. The thing that stops you in your tracks and keeps you there are its eyes. Its inhuman, blazing gold eyes. They stare into your very soul and burn you with the knowledge that you are about to be introduced to your creator.</p>

    <p>You do not realize that you've been slowly stepping backwards until your heel catches on something soft. You make the mistake of breaking eye contact and look down to see what's left of poor Johann. His eyes are wide and sightless, and there is a bloody hole where his heart used to be. More chunks of him are missing, but the cavity on the left side of his chest is what you focus on before you're knocked to the ground.</p>

    <p>You look up. Your eyes meet the molten gold of the creature's. Someone is calling your name. It sounds like Fritz. You open your mouth to scream for him to go, to get help, but there's a sudden pain in the left side of your chest and then everything turns dark.</p>

    <p>You don't know what to say. Johann was alive just a few minutes ago. You spoke with him, and let him investigate on his own, and now he's little more than a pile of skin and meat that used to be a boy. You never even heard him die.</p>

The creature moves faster than your mind can recognize, and you don't even realize that Fritz is dead until his body hits the ground. Your own death is just as quick.

    <p>You make it to Bedburg, in the end. You reach the orange lamplight of the gates and scream to be let in.</p>
  choice1: There is something chasing me, you cry. It took Lena! It took all of them!

    <p>The townspeople open the gate and let you in. You're introduced to Bedburg's alderman. They've been expecting you, after all. You're shown a place to rest, but it is impossible to get any sleep that night.</p>

    <p>You don't know if there is any truth to what the stories that you've heard about this place, but <i>something</i> killed Lena. That something likely killed Johann and Fritz as well.</p>
  choice1: The full moon mocks you through the window.

    <p>The next day, a search party is sent out into the woods, and your suspicions of Johann and Fritz's fate are confirmed when their are found mangled and torn apart. Their mothers hold each other and weep when they hear the news. They were just kids.</p>

    <p>They search party couldn't find Lena. The only sign of her is the blood on the road and a torn scrap of her dress on a nearby tree. A secret part of you wishes that they never find her, because it is likely that she suffered a fate worse than that of her friends.</p>

    <p>You owe it Lena, Johann, and Fritz to find the thing that murdered them. You will stop at nothing until you do.</p>
