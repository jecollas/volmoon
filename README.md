# Volmoon

> Something is hunting the people of Bedburg, Germany. Or at least, that's what the townsfolk there are claiming. You've been receiving frantic letters and reports about this for some time now. Cows mutilated, children going missing, and the bodies of young men and women found mangled in the woods almost beyond recognition. Ordinarily, you would have written all of this off as hysteria over an unfortunate series of animal attacks (wolves aren't uncommon in that area, after all), but things had changed when you received word of a most gruesome discovery.

Volmoon is an interactive historical horror game about the disturbing events of Bedburg, Germany in the fall of 1589. It is told in second-person POV, where you (yes, you!) assume the role of investigator and outsider. It's up to you to solve the case, but can you survive long enough to even get there?
